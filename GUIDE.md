# Administrative and User Guide

Admins will be in charge of configuring the ownCloud server and creating users with the needed permissions. For the process to install and configure the ownCloud server see the [**Manually Installing ownCloud with the Linux Command Line**](MANUAL-INSTALL.md) topic.

## Admin Task: Creating a User Account

As an Administrator user, from the 'Users' page, there will be a table showing all created users. At the top of this table there are three fields with a 'Create' button.

1. **Username** - This value will be the user name that your created user will need to login. The username may contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), dashes (-), underscores (_), periods (.), and at signs (@).
1. **E-Mail** - The user's email where their generated first-use password will be sent.
1. **Groups** - This dropdown field allows the admin to move users to created groups. By default, users are unassigned. 

When completed as desired, select the Create button to add the user. Admins may select additional fields to show on the table of users. For information on these configurations, see the [**User Configuration**](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.6/admin_manual/configuration/user/user_configuration.html#creating-a-new-user) section of the Admin Manual.

## User Task: Basic User Actions
When using the ownCloud Web interface, users willl see the Files page. This is where the user may upload new files, remove files, and share any files from the respository. Users may also make changes based on how their permissions are set by the administrator.
